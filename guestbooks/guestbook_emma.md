#### Welcome to Emma's Project Guestbook:
## [Analyzing Political Rhetoric](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2021/PoliticalRhetoric-analysis)

- I like the organization of your jupyter notebook, it is easy to follow and your notes explaining the steps help as well.
- There were some sections where you printed very long sections of text/big dataframes. I think in general limiting it would make the notebook easier to  follow, but I know it is a work in progress:)
- I learned a nice easy function for dropping duplicates in a dataframe (.drop_duplicates()), looks very handy.
