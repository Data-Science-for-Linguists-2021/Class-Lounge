> Thank you for looking over my project! The long section of text/big data frames point was very helpful and was definitely true haha!

- I like the organization of your jupyter notebook, it is easy to follow and your notes explaining the steps help as well.
- There were some sections where you printed very long sections of text/big dataframes. I think in general limiting it would make the notebook easier to  follow, but I know it is a work in progress:)
- I learned a nice easy function for dropping duplicates in a dataframe (.drop_duplicates()), looks very handy.

> Thank you for stopping by my guestbook, Abby! The possible features that you gave are really interesting - I needed help coming up with more ways to go about my analysis, so this was perfect! Also, I’m super glad you pointed out the two politicians and their affiliations, I’ll have to check over that when I go further with my analysis!

- I really like your topic choice and overall organization.  You very wisely chose a somewhat preprocessed dataset, which looked like it saved a lot of time.
- This may be personal preference, but I think it would be interesting to consider more features.  For instance, does being from the west coast
	versus the east coast make more of a difference than political party affiliation in terms of linguistic style?  What about speeches from
	2008 versus speeches from 2020?  Also, there are two errors from one of the kaggle data sets!  Both John Kasich and Colin Powell are
	listed as democrats, but they're actually center-right republicans.
- A really easy way to get rid of unwanted string values is by doing word.strip(unwanted string) in list comprehension.  I overcomplicated
	this in my own data by using regex to substitue an empty value for the unwanted string. strip() is much easier.
