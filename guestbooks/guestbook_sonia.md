# [Language identification to map language relatedness](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2021/languageID-relatedconfusion)
Welcome! Some quick links are to the [progress report](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2021/languageID-relatedconfusion/blob/main/progress_report.md) and to the walkthrough of the data gathering process in [data-explanation.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2021/languageID-relatedconfusion/blob/main/data-explanation.ipynb).

### visit (Frances):
 - One thing that I thought was well done was your idea of how to chunk the text. You pointed out how sentences are difficult to mark out across different languages so I think choosing a round number of characters was really smart!
 - One thing that I noticed that you might need to improve was the disparity in your data sizes between languages. I think that you might've mentioned it in your "to do" section.
 - One thing I learned was that it can take so long for code to run! It makes sense since you have so much data to scrape, but over a day is really long.
