- Your project seems very interesting and highlights something that a lot of people might not even consider about the food industry/ reviews of the food industry. It was surprising to see how much information came from the reviews, as well (stars, categories, hours, etc.) Also, the cuisine function was a cool way to clean up and organize the data so that it would be useful for your analysis
- This might be more stylistic, but it might be helpful to put in column labels for the final data frame in the notebook!

- The data seems to be really well transformed. The different categories you have in your dataframe seem very useful.
- The different IDs are pretty messy looking, but definitely important since that seems to be the way each restaurant/reviewer is identified, do these correspond to actual names?
- Itâ€™s very interesting how the longitude and latitude are recorded!
