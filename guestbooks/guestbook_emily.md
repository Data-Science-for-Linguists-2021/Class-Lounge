## Emily Martin's project

Welcome to my guestbook! Please enjoy looking around at the work I have accomplished so far :)
  Note: This is very much a work in progress

  - Structure was easy to follow and I admire your dedication in manually gathering 100 news articles from 2015 on the Fluechtlingskrise from that one news source
  - For the source you did scrape automatically, I couldn't find explanation of why you limited yourself to 100 articles
  - I learned more about how much work web scraping can be!
    - Thanks for stopping by Sonia! Those article links were certainly a bit of a pain. I originally thought to keep my samples the same size but you are right there is no reason to limit the number to 100 if I don't have to.

  - Very clear and concise goals with an easy-to-understand framework.  Good topic choice - I'm genuinely interested in what you're going to find.
  - It seems like it's going to be very difficult to train a classifier on unlabeled data.
  - Beautiful soup is extremely versatile.  I've wasted a lot of time with my own web scraping by not using it.
    - Thanks for your comments! I certainly have come to appreciate beautiful soup a lot, and I would definitely recommend it as an option to anyone doing scraping.

  - Your project plan file makes it very clear what the goals are of this project, and the project itself is just very well organized. I espeically appreciate how much effort went in to acquiring this data. I only had to scrape from one site and that was a handful. I imagine 4 sites must have been even more trying.
  - A couple of the JNB's (especially zeit.ipynb) throw a lot of text on the screen at once. This could stand to be cut down a bit (though I understand changing it might be a little difficult w/ how it's set up).
  - I am very intrigued by lemmatizers and spaCy as a whole and am curious to see if they might help with my own analysis.
      - Thanks for visiting! I agree that there is a bit more text than is probably necessary, I will make an effort to cut that down. From what I have seen of SpaCy it is super cool and super useful, I recommend!

  - Your presentation jnb is really well organized and it’s cool to see you using spacy (since we just talked about it in class)!
  - While it’s probably useful for you to help visualize there’s a lot of text returned/printed out on the screen that takes up space.
  - The lemmatizer is so cool! It looks super useful and I might try and use it in my project too.
      - Thanks for stopping by! The lemmatizer is definitely very cool and I had a lot of fun feeding it different verb forms :)

  - Very nice and easy-to-understand charts in your main jupyter notebook
  - You wrote that you're pretty sure that the most useful feature, "flüchtling", isn't negative even though your classifier "thinks" it is.  Since it's the most useful feature, see if you can do a little research and see what German citizens say.  That seems like something you'd want to be sure about.
  - I've never seen *pass* in python before.
