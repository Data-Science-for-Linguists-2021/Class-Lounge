Welcome to my guestbook! Please enjoy looking around at the work I have accomplished so far :)
  Note: This is very much a work in progress

  - Structure was easy to follow and I admire your dedication in manually gathering 100 news articles from 2015 on the Fluechtlingskrise from that one news source

  - I learned more about how much work web scraping can be!
