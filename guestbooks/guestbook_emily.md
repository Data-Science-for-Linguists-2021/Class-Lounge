Welcome to my guestbook! Please enjoy looking around at the work I have accomplished so far :)
  Note: This is very much a work in progress

  - Structure was easy to follow and I admire your dedication in manually gathering 100 news articles from 2015 on the Fluechtlingskrise from that one news source
  - For the source you did scrape automatically, I couldn't find explanation of why you limited yourself to 100 articles
  - I learned more about how much work web scraping can be!

  - Very clear and concise goals with an easy-to-understand framework.  Good topic choice - I'm genuinely interested in what you're going to find.
  - It seems like it's going to be very difficult to train a classifier on unlabeled data.
  - Beautiful soup is extremely versatile.  I've wasted a lot of time with my own web scraping by not using it.
