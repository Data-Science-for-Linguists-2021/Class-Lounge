# [Goodreads Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2021/Goodreads-Sentiment-Analysis)

### Ahoy! Welcome to my term-project guestbook. Feel free to have a look at my code and leave a brief review. 

### visit (Frances):
 - One strength is your code. It is very neat and easy to follow along with, as well as effective considering your data output.
 - One thing to improve is scraping reviews from more books. 
 - One interesting thing that you pointed out in your code is how Goodreads labels their reviews not numerically, but with certain phrases in their html.

### visit (Jordan):
 - Seems like you have a good base for your project here, I really liked the multi-indexing you did to keep reviews of one book together, and you seem to have done a good job web scraping.
 - My only concern would be that Na-Rae might want more out of this project besides just creating a sentiment analysis model. Maybe you could do some more analysis by genre or by the age, location, etc. of the reviewer
 - Multi-indexing looks very useful for my project, I'm gonna try implementing it.
