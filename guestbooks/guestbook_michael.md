## Ahoy! Welcome to my term project guestbook.
### Feel free to have a look at my code and leave a brief review.

### visit (Frances):
 - One strength is your code. It is very neat and easy to follow along with, as well as effective considering your data output.
 - One thing to improve is scraping reviews from more books. 
 - One interesting thing that you pointed out in your code is how Goodreads labels their reviews not numerically, but with certain phrases in their html.
