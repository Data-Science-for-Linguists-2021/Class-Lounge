### Hi! This is my project where I will be analyzing documents scraped from the Latin Library website.

- I like the whole idea of your project, I think it is a really interesting idea. I also like how you commented your spider script so it was easy to follow
- I know this is a work in progress, but it would be nice to see a notebook with a collection of the data.
- I learned a lot about building a spider, and also that there are an awful lot of declensions in Latin!
Response:
- Thank you for your comments! Yeah, Latin has 5 (6 if you count the vocative) cases!

- Based off of the progress report, project plan, and notebook, you definitely seem to know what you’re working with/what you’re looking to get out of the data
- The data frame might be a little easier to read if the data was cleaned up a little (removing the ‘\n’ and ‘\t’), unless you want those in there for a reason!
- I honestly didn’t even think of making a scraper on Jupyter notebook (I made mine using command line), so this was definitely helpful to see in action.
Response:
- Thanks for your response! I did end up cleaning the data (you're right, it makes it difficult to read). I didn't even think about building a scraper through command line, that's so neat!

- Your code is really easy to follow since you show plenty of samples of data structures and other objects as you're working with them. It's easy to just skim through and glance.
- I was wondering, is there a way you're going to automatically label the works in your dataset for what era and genre they are? And similarly with metric conformity in the text as mentioned in your project plan. It might be time-consuming to do this manually unless you're just planning to pick a few examples.
- For some reason I always imagined web crawling/scraping spiders as being really slow, so it was good/surprising to see yours only taking about 10 seconds.

- Your overall plan/idea is extremely precise and pointed (get it??).  I think by focusing on one word (or synset, since there are 5 separate words for it), you'll be able to draw some very interesting and definitive conclusions from the data.
- I'm a little confused by the choice to do dataframe index separated by a "|" for each declension.  Wouldn't it save a lot of typing to use for-looping and dictionaries? 
- I had no idea that a "|" is just an "or" operator".  I'm sure I learned it at one point, then forgot it somewhere along the way.
