### Hi! This is my project where I will be analyzing documents scraped from the Latin Library website.

- I like the whole idea of your project, I think it is a really interesting idea. I also like how you commented your spider script so it was easy to follow
- I know this is a work in progress, but it would be nice to see a notebook with a collection of the data.
- I learned a lot about building a spider, and also that there are an awful lot of declensions in Latin!
Response:
- Thank you for your comments! Yeah, Latin has 5 (6 if you count the vocative) cases!

- Based off of the progress report, project plan, and notebook, you definitely seem to know what you’re working with/what you’re looking to get out of the data
- The data frame might be a little easier to read if the data was cleaned up a little (removing the ‘\n’ and ‘\t’), unless you want those in there for a reason!
- I honestly didn’t even think of making a scraper on Jupyter notebook (I made mine using command line), so this was definitely helpful to see in action.
Response:
- Thanks for your response! I did end up cleaning the data (you're right, it makes it difficult to read). I didn't even think about building a scraper through command line, that's so neat!
