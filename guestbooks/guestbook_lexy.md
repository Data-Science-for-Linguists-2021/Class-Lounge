- I really like the concept of this project, it seems like a great area to use linguistic data science with. The way you collected the best rappers of all time is great, when you were first telling the class about this project I was wondering how you'd choose which rappers to include, but a community-made list seems like a great choice. It'll be very interesting to see how the themes expressed in rap change over time.
- Since your project is specifically about the black experience, I wonder what your methodology is going to be to filter out rappers who aren't black. In addition, you might find some issues in groups like Bad Meets Evil where it will be difficult to separate Royce da 5'9's lyrics from Eminem's lyrics.
- I learned that Genius has an API, that sounds like a great resource compared to doing web scraping

- Your project is very well annotated and easy to follow through the comments.
- I think you mentioned it, but cleaning the data could be a good idea (although from what you included it doesn’t look too bad, just some \n characters).
- Interesting that Genius has its own package for lyrics!

- This is a really interesting project and I look forward to the presentation! I am impressed how you worked around the roadblocks in collecting your data, I know from experience that can be a longer process than anticipated!
- What tools will you be using to complete your analysis? Are the specific thematic representations and words they use something that is commonly ascribed to rap or will you make you own list? I know this is all to come but I am curious as to how exactly you are going to achieve your goal.
- I learned about the importance of utilizing others code to further your own project.

- Your process markdown file was a really cool idea to show the way you went about collecting that data. I also really liked how thorough you were with your data collection, it was really clear how much you are interested in the analysis of your topic!
- There still seems to be more you have to do to start your analysis, but you note that in your 10th log, so I’m sure you have that planned out!
- pip install lyricsgenius

- This project is a very interesting exercise in sociolinguistics.  I absolutely love the title and concept.
- Is lyricsgenuis able to scrape other data?  In the project plan, you mentioned comparing lyrical topics by year, and I think that was a great idea (but I very much understand if plans had to be scrapped once the project actually got going).  Since male versus female is a data point you already have, it would be interesting to do statistical comparison of male versus female topics.
- As Emily mentioned, building from others' work is extremely helpful.  There's a lot of already-written code out there!
