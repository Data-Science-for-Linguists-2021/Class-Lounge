- I really like the concept of this project, it seems like a great area to use linguistic data science with. The way you collected the best rappers of all time is great, when you were first telling the class about this project I was wondering how you'd choose which rappers to include, but a community-made list seems like a great choice. It'll be very interesting to see how the themes expressed in rap change over time.
- Since your project is specifically about the black experience, I wonder what your methodology is going to be to filter out rappers who aren't black. In addition, you might find some issues in groups like Bad Meets Evil where it will be difficult to separate Royce da 5'9's lyrics from Eminem's lyrics.
- I learned that Genius has an API, that sounds like a great resource compared to doing web scraping

- Your project is very well annotated and easy to follow through the comments.
- I think you mentioned it, but cleaning the data could be a good idea (although from what you included it doesnâ€™t look too bad, just some \n characters).
- Interesting that Genius has its own package for lyrics!
