# To-do 10: Past Project Critiques

## Na-Rae the fake student
- Project 1: [Document Clustering](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering) by Dan Zheng
   - Strength: has a lot of code
   - Possible improvement: need more code
   - One thing I learned: providing [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering/blob/master/requirements.txt) along with installation instruction for future guests was a great idea. It streamlines `pip` installation.  

- Project 2: some other project
