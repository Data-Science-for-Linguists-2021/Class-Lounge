# To-do 10: Past Project Critiques

## Na-Rae the fake student
- Project 1: [Document Clustering](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering) by Dan Zheng
   - Strength: has a lot of code
   - Possible improvement: need more code
   - One thing I learned: providing [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering/blob/master/requirements.txt) along with installation instruction for future guests was a great idea. It streamlines `pip` installation.  

- Project 2: some other project   

## Frances
- [Spell Checker Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Spell-Checker)
  - Strength: This was an ambitious project with complicated code and a lot of data.
  - Possible improvement: The code is in a bunch of different files.
  -One thing I learned: [This](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) spell-checker model by Peter Norvig was a super interesting thing to include and provides a way for anyone looking at this project to get an idea of how to build their own spell-checker.

## Emma
- Project 1: [Arabic Learner Corpus Considerations](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Arabic-Learner-Corpus-Considerations/blob/master/final_report.md) by Anthony Verardi
  - Strength: The researcher had a lot of familiarity with the topic and was also flexible in their approach/research question. They also focused on addressing the challenges that might have arisen when trying to use the ALC for classifying text.
  - Possible improvement: Their conclusion sounded like "yeah, it can do this thing, but not always", which is valid, but is still sort of weak.
  - One thing I learned: They organized their notebook, report, and repository cleanly, which gave me ideas for how to present my own. They also used similar classifiers that I want to use in my project, so seeing how they utilized those was helpful.  

- Project 2: [Gendered Dialogue in Animated Movies](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue) by Cassie Maz
  - Strength: They had a clear hypothesis and goal in mind while analyzing their data. Their presentation was consistent the entire document (hypothesis -> analysis -> conclusion).
  - Possible improvement: More comments in their jupyter notebook file of their analysis would have been helpful while looking through that.
  - One thing I learned: Once again, their repository gave me a good idea for how to organize my project.

## Michael
- Project 1: [Smoking Gun Classification](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Smoking-Gun-Classification) by Sean Steinle
  - Strength: Lots of good graphs. Does a good job managing such a large and complicated dataset.
  - Possible improvement: Graphs often lack titles. This can get especially confusing when there are 2-or-more similar graphs right next to each other.
  - One thing I learned: K-means clustering is a useful technique for classifying continuous, unlabeled data. It can be used with TF-IDF values to classify an unlabeled set of linguistic data. The elbow method can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

  ## Emily
- Project 1: [Russian Rhyme](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/russian_rhyme) by David Birnbaum
  - Strength: Very well documented with a lot of useful explanations about what he did and why; the notebooks are easy to follow and very informative.
  - Possible improvement: There was an awful lot in the repo and I noticed some duplicates/things that could have been condensed to make the overall project easier to follow.
  - One thing I learned: Wow teaching computer rhymes is a complicated process! I learned about finding consonant clusters, syllable structure and many other features necessary to do ML on rhyme.

- Project 2: [Twitter Positivity Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Twitter-Positivity-Analysis) by Natasha Kamtekar
  - Strength: She did a  good job documenting her progress as things changed and found new ways to get the data she needed (I can relate!). I also liked the use of word clouds to illustrate her findings.
  - Possible improvement: My critique, and she said it herself in the conclusion, would be that the analysis was good but probably could have been a bit more in depth.
  - One thing I learned: How to work around challenges that may arise in gathering the data, and also to save enough time for in depth analysis.

## Abby
- Project 1: [Reddit-Comment-Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Reddit-Comment-Analysis) by Matthew Borbonus (2019)
	- Strength: Saved a lot of time and effort by choosing a project based on an already-made dataset.
	- Possible imporvement: Seemed to lose track of the goal somewhere along the line.  Final report is disorganized and doesn't really contain any useful analysis.
	- One thing I learned: Using a specific question to be answered and basing the data compilation/analysis around that will make the project much easier.  
- Project 2: [Gendered-Interaction-Online](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Gendered-Interaction-Online)
	- Strength: Final report was extremely good and easy to follow - contained meaningful and well-explained analysis.
	- Weakness: No explanation of what the data is - I have to guess that the "Congress" section is facebook responses to posts from Congress members, but she never really clarifies.
	- One thing I learned: Don't be afraid to drop a few goals if they just don't work out (she dropped "hedging" comparison), and the results will still be interesting.
