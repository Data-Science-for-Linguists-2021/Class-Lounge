# To-do 10: Past Project Critiques

## Na-Rae the fake student
- Project 1: [Document Clustering](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering) by Dan Zheng
   - Strength: has a lot of code
   - Possible improvement: need more code
   - One thing I learned: providing [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering/blob/master/requirements.txt) along with installation instruction for future guests was a great idea. It streamlines `pip` installation.  

- Project 2: some other project   

## Frances
- [Spell Checker Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Spell-Checker)
  - Strength: This was an ambitious project with complicated code and a lot of data.
  - Possible improvement: The code is in a bunch of different files.
  -One thing I learned: [This](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) spell-checker model by Peter Norvig was a super interesting thing to include and provides a way for anyone looking at this project to get an idea of how to build their own spell-checker.

## Emma
- Project 1: [Arabic Learner Corpus Considerations](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Arabic-Learner-Corpus-Considerations/blob/master/final_report.md)
 - Strength: The researcher had a lot of familiarity with the topic and was also flexible in their approach/research question. They also focused on addressing the challenges that might have arisen when trying to use the ALC for classifying text.
 - Possible improvement: Their conclusion sounded like "yeah, it can do this thing, but not always", which is valid, but is still sort of weak.
 - One thing I learned: They organized their notebook, report, and repository cleanly, which gave me ideas for how to present my own. They also used similar classifiers that I want to use in my project, so seeing how they utilized those was helpful.  

- Project 2: [Gendered Dialogue in Animated Movies](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue)
 - Strength: They had a clear hypothesis and goal in mind while analyzing their data. Their presentation was consistent the entire document (hypothesis -> analysis -> conclusion).
 - Possible improvement: More comments in their jupyter notebook file of their analysis would have been helpful while looking through that.
 - One thing I learned: Once again, their repository gave me a good idea for how to organize my project.
