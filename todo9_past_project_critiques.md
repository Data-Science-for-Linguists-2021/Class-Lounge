# To-do 10: Past Project Critiques

## Na-Rae the fake student
- Project 1: [Document Clustering](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering) by Dan Zheng
   - Strength: has a lot of code
   - Possible improvement: need more code
   - One thing I learned: providing [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering/blob/master/requirements.txt) along with installation instruction for future guests was a great idea. It streamlines `pip` installation.  

- Project 2: some other project   

## Frances
- [Spell Checker Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Spell-Checker)
  - Strength: This was an ambitious project with complicated code and a lot of data.
  - Possible improvement: The code is in a bunch of different files.
  -One thing I learned: [This](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) spell-checker model by Peter Norvig was a super interesting thing to include and provides a way for anyone looking at this project to get an idea of how to build their own spell-checker.
